A resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement.

## Canonical Correlation Analysis
A method for exploring the relationships between two sets of variables.

## CFI (Comparative Fit Index)
A fit index that compares the fit of a target model to the fit of an independent, or null, model.

## Chi-Square
A statistical test that assesses the overall fit of a model by comparing the observed covariance matrix to the model-implied covariance matrix.

## Cluster Analysis
A technique for grouping similar objects or observations into clusters.

## Communalities
The proportion of each variable's variance that can be explained by the factors in factor analysis.

## Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
A statistical technique used to test how well measured variables represent the number of constructs.

## Correlation Matrix
A table showing correlation coefficients between variables in a dataset.

## Covariance Matrix
A square matrix showing the covariances between pairs of variables in a dataset.

## Cross-Loadings
When an indicator variable has a high loading on more than one factor.

## Degrees of Freedom
The number of values in a study that are free to vary.

## Direct Effect
The influence of one variable on another that is not mediated by any other variable in a causal model.

## Discriminant Analysis
A method used to classify a set of observations into predefined classes based on a combination of features.

## Eigenvalues
Values that represent the amount of variance explained by each factor or component in factor analysis or PCA.

## Endogenous Variables
Dependent variables in a model that are influenced by other variables within the model.

## Exogenous Variables
Independent variables in a model that are not influenced by other variables within the model.

## Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
A statistical method used to uncover the underlying structure of a set of variables and identify latent (unobserved) factors.

## Factor Loadings
Correlation coefficients between variables and factors in factor analysis.

## Factor Scores
Composite variables which provide information about an individual's placement on the factor(s).

## Generalized Least Squares (GLS)
An alternative estimation method in SEM that is less sensitive to non-normality.

## Goodness-of-Fit Measures
Statistical indicators that assess how well a model fits the observed data.

## Homoscedasticity
A condition where the variability of a variable is equal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it.

## Indirect Effect
The influence of one variable on another that is mediated by at least one other variable in a causal model.

## Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Test
A measure of sampling adequacy for factor analysis.

## Latent Variables
Variables that are not directly observed but are inferred from other observed variables.

## MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance)
An extension of ANOVA that allows for the comparison of multivariate sample means across groups.

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation
A common method for estimating parameters in SEM and factor analysis.

## Measurement Model
The part of an SEM that deals with the relationships between latent variables and their indicators.

## Mediation
An analysis that explores whether the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable is transmitted through a third variable.

## Model Identification
The condition where a unique solution can be found for all of the parameters in an SEM model.

## Modification Indices
Suggested changes to an SEM model that could improve its fit.

## Moderation
An analysis that examines whether the relationship between two variables changes at different levels of a third variable.

## Multicollinearity
A condition where two or more predictor variables in a model are highly correlated, leading to unreliable estimates.

## Multidimensional Scaling
A technique for visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases in a dataset.

## Multivariate Analysis
The observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time.

A method in factor analysis that allows factors to be correlated with each other.

## Observed Variables (Manifest Variables)
Variables that are directly measured or observed in a study.

## Orthogonal Rotation
A method in factor analysis that produces uncorrelated factors.

## Parsimony
The principle of using the simplest possible statistical model that still explains the data well.

## Partial Least Squares (PLS)
A method for constructing predictive models when factors are many and highly collinear.

## Path Analysis
A statistical technique that examines direct and indirect relationships between variables using only observed variables.

## Path Coefficients
Values that represent the strength and direction of relationships between variables in a model.

## Path Diagrams
Graphical representations of the hypothesized relationships among variables in a model.

A type of oblique rotation that allows factors to be correlated.

## RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation)
A fit index that measures the discrepancy between the hypothesized model and the population covariance matrix.

A comprehensive statistical approach that models complex relationships among both observed and latent variables.

## Structural Model
The part of an SEM that specifies the relationships among latent variables.

## Suppressor Variable
A variable that increases the predictive validity of another variable when included in a regression equation.

## TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index)
A fit index similar to CFI that penalizes for model complexity.

## Total Effect
The sum of the direct and indirect effects of one variable on another in a causal model.
