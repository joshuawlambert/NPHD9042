# Introduction to Multivariate Analysis

---

## Goal

- Understand the basics of multivariate analysis
- Learn its purpose and applications

---

## Definition of Multivariate Analysis

- Observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time
- Particularly powerful in healthcare research

---

### Multiple Outcome Variables

- Considers multiple outcome variables simultaneously
- Captures interrelationships and interactions between variables

---

### Example: Drug Study

- Examines blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate differences
- Compares new drug group with placebo group

---

### Application in Healthcare Research

- Patient and clinical outcomes are often interconnected
- Study outcomes together for better insights

---

### Example: Patient Recovery

- Analyzes recovery impact on lifestyle (diet, exercise)
- Provides accurate picture compared to isolated factor study

---

### Comprehensive Understanding

- Uncover patterns and relationships not evident in uni/bivariate analysis


# Overview of Discriminant Analysis

---

## Purpose

- Classify observations into predefined groups
- Identify variables that differentiate between groups

---

### Example: Risk Categories

- Classify patients based on clinical measurements

---

## Process

- Collect data on multiple predictor variables
- Define group membership for each observation

---

### Apply Discriminant Function

- Identify combination of variables that best separate groups
- Example: Predict patient risk using blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI

---

## Applications in Healthcare

- Diagnostic purposes
- Predicting outcomes and identifying risk factors

---

### Example: Treatment Decisions

- Determine treatment based on risk classification

---

## Example Discriminant Analysis

- Use the <a href="Owl Diet.csv" download>Owl Diet.sav</a> dataset
- Fictional information about types of owl diets

---

### JMP Instructions

1. Go to Analyze > Multivariate Methods > Discriminant
2. Select outcome measurements as Y, response, and categorical predictor as X
3. Click OK

---

### R Code Example

```r
#Install Packages
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
library(MASS)

# Read the data file
data <-read_csv("Owl Diet.csv")
str(data)

# Perform the Discriminant Analysis
lda_model <- lda(species ~ skull_length + teeth_row + palatine_foramen + jaw_length, data = data)
print(lda_model)
summary(lda_model)
```

# Overview of MANOVA

---

## Purpose

- Compare multivariate sample means
- Test hypotheses about differences in multiple dependent variables across groups

---

### Example: Treatment Effects

- Examine the effect of different treatments on health outcomes

---

## Process

- Collect data on multiple dependent variables
- Define independent variables or groups

---

### Use MANOVA

- Determine if significant differences exist in multivariate means across groups
- Example: Compare medication effectiveness on multiple symptoms

---

## Applications in Healthcare

- Clinical trials and healthcare studies
- Evaluate intervention effects on multiple outcomes

---

### Example: Lifestyle Intervention

- Assess overall impact on physical and mental health outcomes

---

## Example MANOVA

- Use the <a href="Blood Pressure.csv" download>Blood Pressure.csv</a> dataset
- Fictional data on blood pressure medication and repeated BP measurements

---

### JMP Instructions

1. Go to File > Open and select "Blood Pressure.csv"
2. Go to Analyze > Fit Model
3. Move BP measurements to "Y, Responses"
4. Move Dose to "Construct Model Effects"
5. Select MANOVA in "Personality" dropdown
6. Click Run and select Compound from red triangle menu

---

### R Code Example

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
data_1 <-read_csv("Blood Pressure.csv")

# Perform the MANOVA
manova_model <- manova(cbind(BP_8M, BP_12M, BP_6M, BP_8W) ~ Dose, data = data_1)

# Print and summarize the results
print(manova_model)
summary(manova_model)
```


# Overview of Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

---

## Purpose

- Reduce the number of variables in a dataset
- Retain most of the variation

---

### Identify Principal Components

- Explain the most variance in the data
- Example: Simplify health indicators into principal components

---

## Process

- Standardize the data
- Compute covariance or correlation matrix
- Extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors

---

### Example: Survey Reduction

- Use PCA to reduce survey questions into key factors

---

## Applications in Nursing Research

- Identify key factors influencing patient outcomes
- Simplify complex datasets for analysis

---

### Example: Patient Recovery Study

- Determine main factors contributing to recovery

---

## Example of PCA

- Use the <a href="Body Measurements.csv" download>Body Measurements.csv</a> dataset
- Weight and physical measurements of 22 male subjects

---

### JMP Instructions

1. Go to Analyze > Multivariate Methods > Principal Components
2. Select variables for analysis
3. Click OK
4. Select Scree Plot and Eigenvalues from red triangle menu

---

### R Code Example

```r
# Load Data
your_data <- read.csv("Body Measurements.csv")

# Run PCA
pca_model <- prcomp(your_data, scale = TRUE)

# Print and view results
print(pca_model)
summary(pca_model)
plot(pca_model)

# Scree Plot
plot(pca_model, type = "l")
```


# Overview of Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)

---

## Purpose

- Identify underlying structure of a set of variables
- Identify unobserved (latent) factors

---

### Example: Survey Data

- Explore dimensions of patient-reported outcomes in a quality of life survey

---

## Process

- Collect data on multiple observed variables
- Compute correlation matrix
- Extract factors using methods like principal axis factoring or maximum likelihood
- Rotate factors for simpler interpretation

---

### Example: Health Survey

- Identify factors like physical health, mental health, and social functioning

---

## Applications in Nursing Research

- Identify latent constructs
- Understand dimensions of complex constructs like patient satisfaction

---

### Example: Nurse Burnout

- Uncover factors contributing to nurse burnout

---

## Example of EFA

- Use the <a href="Williams.sav" download>Williams.sav</a> dataset
- 28-item questionnaire on organizational ability

---

### JMP Instructions

1. Go to Analyze > Multivariate Methods > Factor Analysis
2. Select variables and place them into the Y, columns
3. Select variance estimation method (e.g., REML) and click OK
4. Review factor loadings and scree plot

---

### R Code Example

```r
# Install and load the libraries
install.packages("haven")
install.packages("psych")
library(haven)
library(psych)

# Read the file
efa_data <- read.csv("Williams.sav")

# Run the EFA
efa_result <- fa(efa_data, nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax")
print(efa_result)
fa.diagram(efa_result)
```
