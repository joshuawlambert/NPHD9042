### Course Pre/Co-Requisites

To take this course, you must: - Have taken the following courses:
NPHD9000 and 9040 (minimum grade C/Pass)

### Course Description

This course is the first of two that introduce advanced statistical
methods used in doctoral-level nursing research. Method selection,
application, results interpretation, and presentation are stressed in a
flipped-classroom/workshop format. Methods introduced include partial
correlation, multi-way ANOVA, ANCOVA, multiple regression, logistic
regression, and multilevel models. An introduction to power and sample
size calculation by method is also covered.

### Student Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to: 1. Select the
appropriate multivariate analysis method based on research objectives
and types of variables to be analyzed. 2. Generate required sample size
and power for prototypical analyses by multivariate method, concurrently
addressing inclusion of under-represented groups in research. 3. Display
an introductory level ability to manage data and conduct preliminary
analyses to assess and address data quality and potential violations of
statistical assumptions by multivariate method. 4. Demonstrate an
introductory level ability to generate results, using selected
statistical analysis software (e.g., JMP, SPSS, SAS or R), and interpret
relevant results generated for each method.

### Teaching Strategies

-   Weekly Lectures
-   Academic Methodology Journal Articles
-   Statistical Software Workshops
-   Quizzes
-   Group Project Proposals
-   Group Presentations
-   Group Papers
-   Class Peer Review

Active learning strategies will be used throughout the semester.
Examples include faculty and student-led discussions, short paper
reviews, creating professional academic documents, and presentations.

The textbook readings and additional resources posted in the modules
provide background information so you can explore, learn about, discuss,
and debate the use of statistical analysis in research.

Grammar, spelling, and correct statistical formatting are critical
components of scholarly written communication and all professional
communication. Please include references when referring to the work of
others.
