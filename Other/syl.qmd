### Course Description

This course is the second of two which introduce advanced statistical methods in doctoral level nursing research.  Multivariate method selection, application, and results interpretation and presentation are stressed in a flipped-classroom / workshop format. Methods introduced include: MANOVA, MANCOVA, factor analysis, principle components analysis, and structural equation modeling. An introduction to power and sample size calculation by method is integrated throughout.

### Student Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to: 

1.	Select the appropriate multivariate analysis method based on research objectives and types of variables to be analyzed.

2.	Generate required sample size and power for prototypical analyses by multivariate method, concurrently addressing inclusion of under-represented groups in research.

3.	Display an introductory level ability to manage data and conduct preliminary analyses to assess and address data quality and potential violations of statistical assumptions by multivariate method.

4.	Demonstrate an introductory level ability to generate results, using selected statistical analysis software (e.g., SPSS, JMP, SAS or R), and interpret relevant results generated for each method. Pre- & Co-requisites
