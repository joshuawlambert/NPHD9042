## Data Dictionary for hsb2.csv

Two hundred observations were randomly sampled from the High School and Beyond survey, a survey conducted on high school seniors by the National Center of Education Statistics.

200 observations and 11 variables:

-   **Id**: unique identifier
-   **Female**: 0=male, 1=female
-   **Race**: 1=Hispanic, 2=Asian, 3=African-American, 4=Caucasian
-   **SES**: 1=Low, 2=Middle, 3=High
-   **Schtype**: 1=Public, 2=Private
-   **Prog**: 1=General, 2=Academic, 3=Vocational
-   **Read**: Reading Score
-   **Write**: Writing Score
-   **Math**: Math Score
-   **Science**: Science Score
-   **Socst**: Social Studies Score

## Questions


### 1. Use hsb2.csv to estimate the parameters

-   **Estimate the parameters**: a1, a2, b1, b2, b3, e1, e2.
-   **Questions**:
    -   What do they mean?
    -   What seems to have the strongest relationship?
    -   What are the purposes of this path analysis?
    -   What does it tell you?
    -   What doesnâ€™t it tell you?

Please explain your answers.

### 2. Use hsb2.csv to estimate the parameters (ignore e1-e5)

-   **Estimate the parameters**: a1-a4.
-   **Instructions**:
    -   Use SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) to estimate the parameters.
    -   You can use JMP or AMOS to answer this question.
    -   The dependent variable is a latent variable **Acad** with three observed indicators: **math**, **science**, and **socst**.
    -   There are two additional observed variables: the independent variable **female** and a mediator variable **read**.
-   **Questions**:
    -   What do these estimates mean?
    -   From this model, how does **read** affect **Acad**?
    -   Does **Acad** affect the three STEM measures?
    -   Does **female** affect **read**?
