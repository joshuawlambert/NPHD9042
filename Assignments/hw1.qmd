# Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) Assignment

This assignment uses the <a href="SAQ.csv" download>SAQ.csv</a>

Using the provided dataset SAQ.csv, conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). The dataset contains responses from 23 questions developed based on interviews with anxious and non-anxious students. Each question is a statement, and the responses were collected using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree.' The purpose of this tool was to understand how SPSS anxiety could be measured.

## Questions

### 1. Preliminaries

Check the distribution of the questions for floor and ceiling effects. Construct a correlation matrix of the survey items. Put that here and discuss observations that you have.

### 2. Maximum Likelihood and Varimax Rotation

-   What is the conclusion of Bartlett's Test for Sphericity?
-   What does the varimax method assume?
-   How many factors have eigenvalues \> 1?
-   Extract that many factors. What are the rotated factor loadings? Put the table here.
-   What percent of variance do these factors cumulatively explain?
-   How would you interpret these factors? What labels would you give them?

### 3. Principal Axis Factoring and Varimax Rotation

-   Why do we not do Bartlett's Test for PAF?
-   What does the varimax method assume?
-   How many factors have eigenvalues \> 1?
-   Extract that many factors. What are the rotated factor loadings? Put the table here.
-   What percent of variance do these factors cumulatively explain?
-   How would you interpret these factors? What labels would you give them?

### 4. Principal Axis Factoring and Quartimin Rotation

-   What does the varimax method assume?
-   How many factors have eigenvalues \> 1?
-   Extract that many factors. What are the rotated factor loadings? Put the table here.
-   What percent of variance do these factors cumulatively explain?
-   How would you interpret these factors? What labels would you give them?

### 5. Comparison of Analyses

Compare and contrast the analyses from questions 2 to 4. Write one to two paragraphs describing their similarities and differences.
