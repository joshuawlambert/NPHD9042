# Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) Assignment

This assignment uses the <a href="Williams.sav" download>Williams.sav</a>

Use the Williams.sav dataset to complete an exploratory factor analysis. A description of the data and the questions and the dataset can be found on Canvas. Answer the following questions using a statistical software of your choice.

## Questions

### 1. Correlation Matrix

Construct a correlation matrix of the survey items. Put that here and discuss observations that you have.

### 2. Maximum Likelihood and Varimax Rotation

-   What is the conclusion of Bartlett's Test for Sphericity?
-   What does the varimax method assume?
-   How many factors have eigenvalues \> 1?
-   Extract that many factors. What are the rotated factor loadings? Put the table here.
-   What percent of variance do these factors cumulatively explain?
-   How would you interpret these factors? What labels would you give them?

### 3. Principal Axis Factoring and Varimax Rotation

-   Why do we not do Bartlett's Test for PAF?
-   What does the varimax method assume?
-   How many factors have eigenvalues \> 1?
-   Extract that many factors. What are the rotated factor loadings? Put the table here.
-   What percent of variance do these factors cumulatively explain?
-   How would you interpret these factors? What labels would you give them?

### 4. Principal Axis Factoring and Quartimin Rotation

-   What does the varimax method assume?
-   How many factors have eigenvalues \> 1?
-   Extract that many factors. What are the rotated factor loadings? Put the table here.
-   What percent of variance do these factors cumulatively explain?
-   How would you interpret these factors? What labels would you give them?

### 5. Comparison of Analyses

Compare and contrast the analyses from questions 2 to 4. Write one to two paragraphs describing their similarities and differences. Which
